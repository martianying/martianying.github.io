Living alone in a tiny apartment like me is not an easy stuff especially during the pandemic. I play ukulele a lot and sing along to it, which saves me out of depression. Coincidentally, I've learned that some acquaintances actually did street shows before and I was thinking to myself why not asked them to do that again sometime and it would be awesome. Three weeks later, we actually ended up in the Odori park and singing in front of pedestrians.
