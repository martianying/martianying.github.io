	<h1> >> Hello world <br> >> I'm Ying Zhang!</br></h1>
	<p>
		<a href="/about"><b>about me</b></a> might give you some idea of what I am, <a href="/projects"><b>projects</b></a> is a place where I plan to put what I have done before, though it might demonstrate a wide span. I guess <a href="/blog"><b>blog</b></a> would probably be my favorite part since I am going to write anything I find interesting in my experience. As for <a href="/others"><b>others</b></a>, actually currently I don't know what I want to do with it but I guess I might need it at some point, so it's more like a garage.

		As you can see, this website is more precisely to be called a public playground of mine and it also looks apparently very primitive. I am going to make it more good-looking as I put more content on it.
